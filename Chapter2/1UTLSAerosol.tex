\section{UTLS Aerosol}

The atmosphere of earth is a complex and complicated system that is not completely understood and effects and is effected by the human activities. In the late $18^{\text{th}}$ a theory had been raised that hypothesized that as that as altitude increased the temperature of the atmosphere must decrease and eventually go to absolute zero. This lead to a series of balloon campaigns in the late $19^{\text{th}}$ to discover this mysterious point in the atmosphere, however during these flights it was found that at approximately 12~km an inversion point was discovered where the temperature started to increase and thus the tropopause, which separates troposphere and the stratosphere, was discovered \citep{Hoinka1997}.
