Full Command: \texttt{DisableAutoSendStats}\\

Disables the sending of statistics for each image taken. By default enabled.

\subsection{Command:SetScienceMode}

Parameter: \texttt{scienceMode} is a numerical value of the science mode to be run.

Parameter: \texttt{exposureMode} is a numerical value of the science mode to be run.\\

Allows the user to change science mode and exposure modes that ALI is preforming. The science mode is a predetermined cycle of images to perform a specific scientific goal and a table containing all of the modes is listed \autoref{tab:B.1:ScienceModes} and a complete description of each cycle is presenting in \autoref{sec:B.2:ScienceModes}. The exposure mode is a predetermined exposure time lnegth to be used for each wavelength and a table containing all of the modes is listed \autoref{tab:B.1:ExposureModes} and a complete description of each mode is presenting in \autoref{sec:B.3:ExposureModes}. The next mode will be loaded once the current mode is complete. By default the program is set in Invalid Mode,Invalid Mode.

\subsection{Command:ReloadConfig}

Full Command: \texttt{ReloadConfig}\\

Upon completion of the current science cycle the current science mode cycle will be reload from the configuration files.

\subsection{Command:LdCusCnf}

Full Command: \texttt{LdCusCnf IsOneExp,NumExp,wavelegth,RFPower\ldots}

Parameter: \texttt{IsOneExp} is either a 0 or a 1. A 0 represents each exposure will have a different exposure time where a 1 representats that te exposure time used for the first image will be the same for all images.

Parameter: \texttt{NumExp} is the number of exposures the custom science mode will contain

Parameter: \texttt{wavelength,RFPower\ldots} is a pair of information for each image in the cycle as defined by \texttt{NumExp} consisting of a wavelength in nanometers and a RF power rangeing from 0 to 1.\\

Uploads values for a custom science mode. The first value is the number of exposures followed by a number of pairs that equal the number of exposures with the pair set of wavelength in nanometers and RF Power. There is no check on the command apart from the right number of inputs. User must verify that the wavelength range is in between 600 and 1000~nm and the RF power is between 0 and 1.

\subsection{Command:LdCusExp}

Full Command: \texttt{LdCusExp numTimes,time\ldots}

Parameter: \texttt{numTimes} is the number of exposure time to be entered.

Parameter: \texttt{time\ldots} is a series of times in seconds separated by commas to match the number of exposure times.\\

Uploads values for a custom exposure time lenth series. The first value is the number of exposures time followed by a series of time in seconds. If custom exposure time is used the number o exposures must match the number of times or an error is sent to the user.

\subsection{Command:GetFile}

Full Command: \texttt{GetFile filename}

Parameter: \texttt{filename} is the image file to be downloaded from ALI with the full path.\\

Gets the requested image file from ALI-OCELOT if it exists.
